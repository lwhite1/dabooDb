# dabuDB

DabuDB is a simple, pure Java document store, supporting transactional reads and writes.

Or, rather, it'll support them soon.

It's is in development. You probably shouldn't use it for production until the 1.0 release is final.

DabuDB is named after my daughter, who, when she first learned to speak, thought her name was "Dabu" - thanks to her big brother. Love you both. 

Here's a rough roadmap:

## 1.0

* Embedded or Client-Server modes
* Reasonable performance & scalability
* Key value functionality
* Pluggable storage engine
* Pluggable support for encryption and compression of data and messages
* Optimistic locking
* Document schema version management

## 2.0

* Performance and scalability enhancements
* A sql-inspired query language
* Secondary indexes
* Full-text-search support

## 3.0

* Backup and restore


More info on APIs, performance, etc. will follow.
