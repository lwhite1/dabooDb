# dabuDB

DabuDB is a simple, pure Java, document store, supporting transactional reads and writes, secondary indexes, and other useful stuff.

Or, rather, it will support them, someday.

DabuDB is in development. You probably shouldn't use it for anything production-like until the 1.0 release is final.

DabuDB is named after my daughter, who, when she first learned to speak, thought her name was "Dabu". Thanks to her brother. Love you both.
