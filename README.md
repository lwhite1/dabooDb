# dabuDB

DabuDB is a simple, pure Java, document store, supporting transactional reads and writes.

Or, rather, it will support them, soon.

DabuDB is in development. You probably shouldn't use it for production until the 1.0 release is final.

DabuDB is named after my daughter, who, when she first learned to speak, thought her name was "Dabu" - thanks to her big brother. Love you both. 

Here's some other things I'm doing, or plan to do:

* Embedded or Client-Server modes
* Secondary indexes
* Full-text-search support
* A sql-inspired query language
* Optimistic locking
* Backup and restore
* Document schema versioning

I think it will be useful for a number of use-cases. More info on APIs, peformance, etc. will follow.
