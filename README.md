# dabuDB

DabuDB is a simple, pure Java document store.

It's is in development. You probably shouldn't use it for production until the 1.0 release is final.

DabuDB is named after my daughter, who thought her name was "Dabu" when she was very young - thanks to her big brother. Love you both. 

Here's a rough roadmap:

## 1.0

* Embedded mode only
* Key value functionality
* Reasonable performance
* Pluggable storage engine
* Pluggable support for encryption and compression of data and messages

## 2.0

* Client-Server or embedded modes
* Good performance & reasonable scalability
* Optimistic locking
* Document schema version management
* Simple transactions

## 3.0

* Performance and scalability enhancements
* A sql-inspired query language
* Secondary indexes
* Full-text-search support

## 4.0

* Backup and restore


More info on APIs, performance, etc. will follow.
